				<h2 class="text-center text-uppercase pb-3">Why we believe in Winds of Joy</h2>
				<p>For many, Winds of Joy is the first step on a journey of change. Most times this journey begins when participants see new 
				horizons and they realise they don't need to be defined or confined 
				by their circumstances. Seeing the magic moment when the 
				'penny drops' and change starts, is what motivates us to do this 
				work.</p>

				  <p>"For the kids we take out sailing, the experience 
				  might as well be a trip to the moon because it is so far outside 
				  of their normal environment.<br><br>There’s no air-conditioning, 
				  no artificial light, no noise. It’s just nature, pushing the boat 
				  along. The kids get to steer the yacht, and when it takes off in a 
				  gust and they feel the acceleration, it’s like the boat’s alive 
				  and they are riding on a dragon’s back on a sea that has been 
				  there since the dawn of time.<br><br>Who knows how this will 
				  stimulate their imagination and where that will take them?"</p>

				<p>Our yachts are specially adapted to take wheelchairs. Using a 
				electronic joystick, pretty much everyone on board can have a go 
				at steering the boat. Our skippers and volunteers are trained to 
				offer support, kindness, and a positive environment which 
				encourages our participants and stimulates their imaginations.</p>

				  <p>"On behalf of all from Waratah Day Program who

				  to say thank you to Sailors with disABILITIES and the skipper 
				  and all of the crew who made the day such a memorable

				  <p>"Every time we go sailing with Sailors with 
				  disABILITIES we know we are going to have a fantastic day. Our 
				  students with special educational needs, find sailing a very 
				  exciting and pleasant experience. Being on a boat and going 
				  in the same direction, brings everyone together. We truly 
				  appreciate this opportunity as it allows our students to feel 
				  fully included and accepted by the members of the crew. This 
				  consequently has a positive impact on our students' 
				  self-esteem and social confidence. You have been doing a great 
				  job! I can't thank you enough!"</p>
